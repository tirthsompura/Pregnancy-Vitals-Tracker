# Pregnancy-Vitals-Tracker
A Jetpack Compose + MVVM Android app for pregnancy health tracking.
It allows users to log vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, weight, baby kicks) and track them in real time.
Additionally, it includes a timer service that runs in the background, even if the app is killed, and continuously updates the UI.
